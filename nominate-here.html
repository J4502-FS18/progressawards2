<p>The Missourian Progress Awards recognize the people who help make Columbia a great place to live and move us forward every year.</P>

<p>This is our second awards program designed to lift up people who are engaged in our community and who may not be recognized for their contributions otherwise.</P>

<p>Award categories range from civic engagement to sustainability to philanthropy â€” there's a category for everyone in our community.</P>

<p>Winners and nominees will be recognized at the Progress Awards event and in a special edition of the Missourian in December.
</p>
