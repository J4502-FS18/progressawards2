    <p>When law professor Angela Drake's students approached her with the proposition to start a veterans clinic at MU, the idea strongly resonated with her.</p>
    <p>The students were veterans themselves who had attended the National Veterans Law Moot Court Competition, where they learned of other law schools with clinics that were helping veterans with their claims.</p>
    <p>Angela grew up as an Army brat. Her father served in the 101st Airborne and was killed in Vietnam.</p>
    <p>She felt compelled to help veterans navigate the complicated legal health system and provide students with hands-on law practice.</p>
    <p>With her students, Angela found the funding to start the clinic, and it opened its doors in January 2014. Since then, it has served 65 veterans and recovered a total of about a million and a half dollars in benefits for them.</p>
    <p>We talked to Angela about her work and her nomination. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>
    <h3>Why do you think education is important?</h3>
    <p>I can’t imagine doing anything without education, or doing it well. If you look at VA regulations and the book in which they’re contained that literally weighs 15 pounds, you can’t do it without somebody educating you on how to get through that, so for my world, and for what I care about, which is helping our nation’s veterans, education is critical. You can’t just get up one morning and say, ‘I’m going to go help a veteran with their disability claim’ without somebody having sort of paved the way a little bit and holding your hand as you go down the road.</p>
    <h3>What do you enjoy about working in the veterans clinic?</h3>
    <p>What do you enjoy about working in the veterans clinic?
It is really amazing to have students help people who really need the help. The paperwork with VA is truly overwhelming, and the system and the delays and all that is very hard for veterans to get through, especially when they have disabilities, so I probably have one of the best jobs in the world to match students with people who really need the help. I want to create a network of former students now lawyers who are out there with the skills ready to help veterans.</p>
